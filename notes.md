Discuss with your teammate:
In a sentence, what does types.h contain? --> It creates short names for some number types, so instead of writing unsigned int, unsigned short, or unsigned char, you can just write uint, ushort, or uchar, and it also gives uint another name: pde_t.
In a sentence, what does stat.h contain? --> It defines some number labels (T_DIR, T_FILE, T_DEV) to represent different file types and creates a stat structure to store information about a file, like its type, size, and location on the disk.
In a sentence, what does user.h contain? List 6 (or more) functions that look like ones you have used before. --> It sets up some system commands for things like running programs, reading and writing files, and managing memory, plus some helper functions for handling text, memory, and printing.
